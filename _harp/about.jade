  # T2G Resource Hub

  This is a repository of various learning resources that the teen development community may find useful, 
  in technology competencies such as **UI/UX Design**, **Front-End Development**, and **Back-End Development**. 

  It has been created as a part of the [Teen2Geek](http://teen2geek.com) initiative, which strives to create a 
  stronger adolescent developer community through crowdsourced learning resources, a social news platform for 
  discussion, as well as an internship board targeted towards teens.

  ## Contribute

  ### Add to the list(s)

  Adding to this list is currently done via pull request through the [project's Github repository](http://github.com/krrishd/t2g-resource-hub). 
  To do so, simply modify the ```_harp/_data.json``` file's relevant section in your own fork, and then open a pull request. For example, to add a 
  paid resource, simply add the following to the relevant section:

  ```json
  "nameOfResource": {
          "name": "New Resource - What Resource Is",
          "url": "http://path/to/new/resource",
          "paid": true // ONLY INCLUDE IF PAID
  },
  ```

  ### Contribute to development

  First, here's some technical specifications:

  * All code is compiled from [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org) to HTML and CSS

  * Asset Pipeline is [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com) (v0.10.0), compiles all the Jade/LESS files in the ```_harp/``` folder to static HTML/CSS in the primary folder

  * Hosted on Github Pages

  To run the server on your local machine, you first need NodeJS and NPM. Then, install harp like:

  ```bash
  $ sudo npm install -g harp
  ```

  Then, go into the directory of the project and type:

  ```bash
  $ harp server _harp
  ```

  Your server should then be running at ```localhost:9000```. From there, make all modifications to the Jade and LESS files in the ```_harp``` directory.
